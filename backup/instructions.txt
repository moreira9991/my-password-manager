Password Manager – Backup Instructions
===============================

Thank you for using the Password Manager.

This file explains how to use the backup file included in the ZIP archive.

IMPORTANT
---------
• The backup file is fully encrypted.
• You **must** know your master password to open it.
• Never share your master password with anyone.
• Keep this backup in a safe place.

-----------------------
1. What you received
-----------------------
You received a ZIP file, for example:

    password_manager_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.zip

Inside this ZIP file you will find:
• An encrypted vault file (with extension .pmdb)
• This instructions.txt file

-------------------------------
2. How to restore the backup
-------------------------------

Follow these steps to restore your vault from the backup:

1) Save the ZIP file to your computer.

2) Extract the contents of the ZIP file
   (for example: Right click → “Extract here”).

3) Locate the extracted encrypted vault file.
   It will look similar to:

       vault_backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.pmdb

4) Move this .pmdb file to the root folder of the Password Manager.

5) Rename the file to:

       vault.pmdb

6) Start the Password Manager application.

7) When prompted, enter your master password.
   If the master password is correct, the application will open the restored vault.

-------------------------------
3. Security recommendations
-------------------------------

• Store the backup in a private and secure location.
• Do not edit or open the .pmdb file with other programs.
• Do not keep backups on public or shared computers.
• Consider creating new backups from time to time as your passwords change.
